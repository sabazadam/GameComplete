## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structure
- Game class with all required fields
- JSON serialization/deserialization with proper handling of missing fields
- In-memory collection of Game objects

### Core Components
1. **MainApp** - Application entry point
2. **GameRepository** - Data access and management
3. **UI Controllers** - Form controllers for different views
4. **ServiceLayer** - Business logic for searching and filtering

### UI Components
1. Main game list view (TableView or ListView)
2. Game detail panel
3. Create/Edit game dialog
4. Search and filter panel
5. Help viewer

### File Handling
- Save/load from user-selected JSON files
- Auto-save on exit
- Backup creation before saving

## Next Steps
Let's start by implementing the Game model class and JSON handling functionality.
